- Logging
- TestCases - switch to test driven developement
- Generate Terrain
    - generate a map of height distribution (x, y associated to a z-value)
    + convert a map of heights to flats (Delaunay Triangulation)
        + get new adjacent flats
    - ocean level
    - surface condition
    - waterflow
- Water
- Perception
    - seeing
        - direction, distance
        - get all objects in an given area (e.g. an triangle)
    - hearing
    - smelling
- General Math
    + circumscribed circle
        + special case 100,75 > triangle is a line
            + test if a point is directly on one side of a triangle
    + point in circle
    - test if a vector intersects a triangle
- Pathfinding    
    - costs for different path (upwards / downwards / terrain condition)
- some sort of graphical representation (what could it look like?)
